# WindowShortcuts
- Adds shortcut keys to assign certain windows to certain shortcut keys

# Usage
- "ctrl + alt + \<number key\>" - Assigns the current window to the given number
- "ctrl + \<number key\>" - switch to the window assigned the given number

## TODO: 
- Add keybinds to open or switch to specific folders 
- Permanent keybinds that persist across restarts
- Disable conflicting existing keybinds
- Find a decent keybind library. Current one goes insane when using ctrl alt down, others are annoying or impossible to use with control keys
